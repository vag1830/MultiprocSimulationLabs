-------------------------------------------

Overview of this directory
--------------------------

This directory contains the code for the "Quicksort" application. This
program implements the quicksort algorithm on a specified array of
integers. The directory is organized as follows:

src:
	contains the source and header files
obj:
	contains the object files (not provided)
execs:
	contains the executable and the predecoded executable
		(used by RSIM)
testoutputs:
	some sample output files

makefile:
	the makefile to produce the executable in the execs directory.

Making the executable
---------------------
An executable with the default compilation options is already provided.
If you desire to make another one, then type
"make execs/quicksort.out.dec" in this directory
(/path_to_rsim/rsim-1.0/apps/QS).


Running the executable with RSIM
--------------------------------

The command line parameters for Quicksort are as follows:

  QS - OPTIONS
      -p - Number of processors
      -s - Size of array
      -b - Bubble threshold
      -B - Bubble
      -d - Display output
      -v - Verify results
      -H - Help

Following are example command lines to run quicksort with RSIM (the outputs
of these runs are found in the testoutputs directory).

These examples run quicksort on the default architecture for 1,2,4,
and 8 processor systems. More examples on how to change the
configuration can be found in the RSIM manual (refer to the docs
directory). Replace "/home/rsim/rsim-1.0" with the actual directory of
the RSIM distribution.

cd /home/rsim/rsim-1.0/apps/QS/execs; /home/rsim/rsim-1.0/obj/ultra140/rsim -f
quicksort -S quicksortp1_1x4d -D../testoutputs -0 /dev/null -z /dev/null -W --
-p1 -s16384 -v

cd /home/rsim/rsim-1.0/apps/QS/execs; /home/rsim/rsim-1.0/obj/ultra140/rsim -f
quicksort -S quicksortp2_1x4d -D../testoutputs -0 /dev/null -z /dev/null -W --
-p2 -s16384 -v

cd /home/rsim/rsim-1.0/apps/QS/execs;/home/rsim/rsim-1.0/obj/ultra140/rsim -f
quicksort -S quicksortp4_1x4d -D../testoutputs -0 /dev/null -z /dev/null -W --
-p4 -s16384 -v 

cd /home/rsim/rsim-1.0/apps/QS/execs; /home/rsim/rsim-1.0/obj/ultra140/rsim -f
quicksort -S quicksortp8_1x4d -D../testoutputs -0 /dev/null -z /dev/null -W --
-p8 -s16384 -v 

NOTE: The problem sizes in these examples are too small to make any
meaningful evaluation of the results from these runs. These examples are
only meant to be representative examples to indicate how to run
applications with RSIM. Also, please verify that the program gives correct
results by testing for the "correct sort" message:

~rsim/rsim-1.0/apps/QS/testoutputs> grep Congrats *out
quicksortp1_1x4d_out:Congrats!! Program successful!! :-)
quicksortp2_1x4d_out:Congrats!! Program successful!! :-)
quicksortp4_1x4d_out:Congrats!! Program successful!! :-)
quicksortp8_1x4d_out:Congrats!! Program successful!! :-)

Utilities to process statistics
-------------------------------

Ensure that your PATH variable is set to include the bin directory of
the RSIM distribution.

########################### PSTATS UTILITY ###########################

To run the pstats utility described in Chapter 6 of the RSIM manual,
type the following in the testoutputs directory:

% pstats quicksortp1_1x4d_err quicksortp2_1x4d_err 1

A sample output of this utility is available in the file
"quicksortpstats" in the testoutputs directory.

######################### STATS_MISS UTILITY #########################

To run the stats_miss utility described in Chapter 6 of the RSIM
manual, type the following in the testoutputs directory:

% stats_miss -cache 1 quicksortp1_1x4d quicksortp2_1x4d 1

A sample output of this utility is available in the file
"quicksortstats_miss" in the testoutputs directory.

########################### PLOTALL UTILITY ##########################

To run the plotall utility described in Chapter 6 of the RSIM manual,
type the following in the testoutputs directory:

% plotall quicksort speedup quicksortp1_1x4d_err quicksortp2_1x4d_err
quicksortp4_1x4d_err quicksortp8_1x4d_err 1

This command produces the files quicksortspeedup_exec.cmd,
quicksortspeedup_exec.ps, quicksortspeedup_wt.cmd, and
quicksortspeedup_wt.ps, where the .cmd files are splot command files,
and the .ps files are postscript files. These files are located in the
testoutputs directory.

############################ MSHR UTILITY ############################

% MSHR quicksort p1 quicksortp1_1x4d_stat 1 p2 quicksortp2_1x4d_stat 1

This command produces MSHR_quicksortL1.cmd , MSHR_quicksortL1.ps ,
MSHR_quicksortL2.cmd, and MSHR_quicksortL2.ps files where the .cmd
files are splot command files and the .ps files are postscript
files. These files are located in the testoutputs directory.
