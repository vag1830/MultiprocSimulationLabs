Overview of this directory
--------------------------

This directory contains the code for the "SOR" application.  This program
performs red-black successive over-relaxation on a grid.  The only printed
output is the execution time.  By default 2 iterations are performed on a
grid of 100 by 100 double-precision floating-point numbers with a single
processor.

src:
	contains the source and header files
obj:
	contains the object files (not provided)
execs:
	contains the executable and the predecoded executable
		(used by RSIM)
testoutputs:
	some sample output files

makefile:
	the makefile to produce the executable in the execs directory.

Making the executable
---------------------
An executable with the default compilation options is already provided.
If you desire to make another one, then type
"make execs/sor.out.dec" in this directory
(/path_to_rsim/rsim-1.0/apps/SOR). 


Running the executable with RSIM
--------------------------------

The command line parameters for SOR are as follows:

       SOR - OPTIONS
          -p - Number of processors
          -m - Number of rows
          -n - Number of columns by 2
          -i - Number of iterations
          -d - Display input and output matrices
          -h - Help

Following are example command lines to run SOR with RSIM (the outputs
of these runs are found in the testoutputs directory).

These examples run SOR on the default architecture for 1,2,4, and 8
processor systems. More examples on how to change the configuration
can be found in the RSIM manual (refer to the docs directory). Replace
"/home/rsim/rsim-1.0" with the actual directory of the RSIM
distribution.

cd /home/rsim/rsim-1.0/apps/SOR/execs; /home/rsim/rsim-1.0/obj/ultra140/rsim
-f sor -S sorp1_1x4d -D../testoutputs -0 /dev/null -z /dev/null -W --
-p1 -m32 -n16 -i4 

cd /home/rsim/rsim-1.0/apps/SOR/execs; /home/rsim/rsim-1.0/obj/ultra140/rsim
-f sor -S sorp2_1x4d -D../testoutputs -0 /dev/null -z /dev/null -W --
-p2 -m32 -n16 -i4 

cd /home/rsim/rsim-1.0/apps/SOR/execs; /home/rsim/rsim-1.0/obj/ultra140/rsim
-f sor -S sorp4_1x4d -D../testoutputs -0 /dev/null -z /dev/null -W --
-p4 -m32 -n16 -i4 

cd /home/rsim/rsim-1.0/apps/SOR/execs; /home/rsim/rsim-1.0/obj/ultra140/rsim
-f sor -S sorp8_1x4d -D../testoutputs -0 /dev/null -z /dev/null -W --
-p8 -m32 -n16 -i4 

NOTE: The problem sizes in these examples are too small to make any
meaningful evaluation of the results from these runs. These examples are
only meant to be representative examples to indicate how to run
applications with RSIM. 

Utilities to process statistics
-------------------------------

Ensure that your PATH variable is set to include the ~rsim/rsim-1.0/bin
directory.


########################### PSTATS UTILITY ###########################

To run the pstats utility described in Chapter 6 of the RSIM manual,
type the following in the testoutputs directory:

prompt% pstats sorp1_1x4d_err sorp2_1x4d_err 1

A sample output of this utility is available in the file "sorpstats"
in the testoutputs directory.

######################### STATS_MISS UTILITY #########################

To run the stats_miss utility described in Chapter 6 of the RSIM
manual, type the following in the testoutputs directory:

prompt% stats_miss -cache 1 sorp1_1x4d sorp2_1x4d 1

A sample output of this utility is available in the file "sorstats_miss"
in the testoutputs directory.

########################### PLOTALL UTILITY ##########################

To run the plotall utility described in Chapter 6 of the RSIM manual,
type the following in the testoutputs directory:

prompt% plotall sor speedup sorp1_1x4d_err sorp2_1x4d_err
sorp4_1x4d_err sorp8_1x4d_err 1

This command produces the files sorspeedup_exec.cmd, sorspeedup_exec.ps,
sorspeedup_wt.cmd, and sorspeedup_wt.ps, where the .cmd files
are splot command files, and the .ps files are postscript files. These
files are located in the testoutputs directory.

############################ MSHR UTILITY ############################

To run the MSHR utility described in Chapter 6 of the RSIM manual,
type the following in the testoutputs directory:

prompt% MSHR sor p1 sorp1_1x4d_stat 1 p2 sorp2_1x4d_stat 1

This command produces MSHR_sorL1.cmd , MSHR_sorL1.ps ,
MSHR_sorL2.cmd, and MSHR_sorL2.ps files where the .cmd files
are splot command files and the .ps files are postscript files. These
files are located in the testoutputs directory.
